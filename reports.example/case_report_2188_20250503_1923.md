# Case Investigation Report: Case 2188

**Runbook Used:** .clinerules/run_books/case_report.md
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-03 19:23 EDT
**Case ID(s):** 2188

## Executive Summary

Case 2188 (Volume Shadow Copy Creation) was opened with Critical priority and involves multiple high-priority alerts indicating credential dumping activity on host `ACTIVEDIR.STACKEDPADS.LOCAL` (10.1.0.4) associated with user `frank.kolzig@stackedpad.local`. Evidence suggests the user downloaded and executed Mimikatz components, followed by the use of `vssadmin.exe` likely to facilitate credential harvesting (e.g., NTDS.dit access). Immediate incident response actions, including host isolation and user account investigation, are recommended.

## Timeline of Key Events (Based on Alert Timestamps)

*   **~2025-04-30 13:24 - 14:24 EDT:** Google Safebrowsing alerts trigger due to file creation events involving Mimikatz components (`mimilib.dll`, `mimilove.exe`) in `C:\Users\fkolzig\Downloads\mimikatz_trunk\...`. Parent process is `explorer.exe` (PID 4656).
*   **~2025-04-30 14:08 EDT:** Alert for "NTDS.dit Extraction via Windows Volume Shadow Copy".
*   **~2025-04-30 14:14 EDT:** Alert for "Volume Shadow Copy Creation" (`vssadmin.exe` launched by `cmd.exe`).
*   **~2025-04-30 14:19 EDT:** Alert for "MimiKatz Command Arguments" (`mimikatz.exe` launched from user's Downloads directory by `cmd.exe`, parent `explorer.exe`). Tagged T1003 (OS Credential Dumping).
*   **~2025-04-30 14:26 EDT:** Alert for "Volume Shadow Copy Creation" (`vssadmin.exe` launched by `cmd.exe`). Tagged T1003.003 (OS Credential Dumping: NTDS).
*   **Other Alerts:** Multiple other alerts related to ATI High Priority Rule Matches for File IOCs and Registry Save alerts (HKLM SAM/SYSTEM) occurred around the same timeframe, further indicating credential access attempts.

## Involved Entities & Enrichment

*   **User:** `frank.kolzig@stackedpad.local` / `frank.kolzig`
*   **Host:** `ACTIVEDIR.STACKEDPADS.LOCAL` (IP: `10.1.0.4`)
*   **Key Processes:**
    *   `C:\Windows\Explorer.EXE` (PID: 4656) - Parent process for Mimikatz download/execution.
    *   `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` (PID: 2192, Parent: 4656) - Launched Mimikatz.
    *   `C:\Users\fkolzig\Downloads\mimikatz_trunk\x64\mimikatz.exe` (PID: 1172, SHA256: `912018ab3c6b16b39ee84f17745ff0c80a33cee241013ec35d0281e40c0658d9`) - Mimikatz executable.
    *   `C:\Users\fkolzig\Downloads\mimikatz_trunk\Win32\mimilove.exe` (SHA256: `dd3f2e3349c378e1a415c4a6ad450cd3ae4ea29f3fe15d0a72bff64a44e1362a`) - Mimikatz component flagged by Safebrowsing.
    *   `C:\Users\fkolzig\Downloads\mimikatz_trunk\x64\mimilib.dll` (SHA256: `d9770865ea739a8f1702a2651538f4f4de2d92888d188d8ace2c79936f9c2688`) - Mimikatz component flagged by Safebrowsing.
    *   `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe` (PID: 4) - Launched `vssadmin.exe`.
    *   `C:\Windows\System32\vssadmin.exe` (PID: 0x1264 / 4708) - Used for Volume Shadow Copy creation.
*   **Enrichment:** (Note: Detailed enrichment was not performed as part of this specific report generation runbook execution, but key IOCs are listed above). The involved file hashes are flagged by Google Safebrowsing. Mimikatz is a known credential dumping tool. VSSAdmin usage is a common technique (T1003.003) for accessing locked credential files like NTDS.dit.

## Analysis & Root Cause

The sequence of events strongly suggests that user `frank.kolzig` downloaded and executed Mimikatz, a known credential dumping tool. Subsequently, `vssadmin.exe` was used to create volume shadow copies, likely to facilitate the extraction of credentials from protected system files (e.g., NTDS.dit, SAM, SYSTEM hives, as indicated by other alerts in the case). The activity appears to be manual execution originating from the user's interactive session (`explorer.exe`).

## Actions Taken (During Report Generation)

*   Retrieved case details and alerts using `get_case_full_details`.
*   Retrieved events for key alerts (14636, 14594, 14602) using `list_events_by_alert`.
*   Synthesized findings into this report.

## Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Containment:** Isolate the host `ACTIVEDIR.STACKEDPADS.LOCAL` using endpoint security tools (Refer to `basic_endpoint_triage_isolation.md`).
2.  **User Account Investigation:** Investigate user account `frank.kolzig@stackedpad.local` for signs of compromise (Refer to `compromised_user_account_response.md`). Consider password reset and session termination.
3.  **Deep Dive Analysis:** Perform a deeper analysis of the Mimikatz execution and VSSAdmin commands used. Examine the contents of the created shadow copies if possible.
4.  **Lateral Movement Check:** Investigate any outbound connections or authentication attempts originating from `ACTIVEDIR.STACKEDPADS.LOCAL` or using `frank.kolzig`'s credentials around the time of the incident.
5.  **Endpoint Forensics:** Consider acquiring forensic images of the affected host for deeper analysis if required.
