## Detailed Findings

### Case & Alert Information
*   **Case ID:** 2228
*   **Display Name:** ATI High Priority Rule Match for Domain Name IoCs (network.dns.questions.name)
*   **Status:** Opened
*   **Priority:** High
*   **Alert ID:** 14909
*   **Alert Name:** ATI HIGH PRIORITY RULE MATCH FOR DOMAIN NAME IOCS (NETWORK.DNS.QUESTIONS.NAME)
*   **Rule Generator:** ATI High Priority Rule Match for Domain Name IoCs (network.dns.questions.name)
*   **Rule ID:** `ur_d7ef6fcd-3062-4695-bc12-21ca1cf6569f` (Note: Logic not retrieved as it's a curated rule)
*   **Alert Time Window:** 2025-05-02T09:36:00Z to 2025-05-02T10:36:00Z

### Involved Entities
*   **Host:** `windows-prod-1`
*   **IP Address:** `10.166.0.3`
*   **Resource Name:** `//compute.googleapis.com/projects/prod-web/zones/europe-north1/instances/windows-prod-1`

### SIEM Event Analysis
*   DNS queries were observed from `10.166.0.3` (`windows-prod-1`) between approx. 2025-05-02 10:20 UTC and 10:34 UTC for the following domains:
    *   `kbfvzoboss.bid`
    *   `sahifatinews.com`
    *   `zfsociety.duckdns.org`
    *   `appsync-api.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud.com`
    *   `siekis.com`
    *   `sharpledge.com`
    *   `hodbeast.com`
    *   `code.newsmarketdata.kz`
    *   `www.aieov.com`
*   An additional DNS query for `eth-eu1.nanopool.org` (a known cryptomining pool) was observed from the same IP around 2025-05-02 21:35 UTC, associated with a different SCC finding (`Malware: Cryptomining Bad Domain`). While outside the specific alert window, this adds context to potential malicious activity on the host.

### Entity Enrichment (GTI)

*   **`10.166.0.3` (SIEM Lookup):** Recognized asset, last seen 2025-05-02 21:35 UTC. No directly associated alerts in the summary.
*   **`kbfvzoboss.bid` (GTI):** Malicious (17 detections, 2 malicious votes), associated with malware collections.
*   **`sahifatinews.com` (GTI):** Malicious (3 detections), associated with QAKBOT campaign, malware, and threat actors.
*   **`zfsociety.duckdns.org` (GTI):** Suspicious (4 detections), known infection source (Dr.Web), dynamic DNS, associated with malware.
*   **`appsync-api.eu-west-1.avsvmcloud.com` (GTI):** Malicious (10 detections), associated with malware/actors, sinkholed SUNBURST C2 domain.
*   **`siekis.com` (GTI):** Malicious (11 detections), associated with malware and threat actors.
*   **`sharpledge.com` (GTI):** Malicious (10 detections), classified as malware/spyware, associated with campaign, malware, and threat actors.

## Analysis & Conclusion

The investigation confirms that the host `windows-prod-1` (IP `10.166.0.3`) made DNS requests to a significant number of domains identified as malicious or highly suspicious by Google Threat Intelligence. This activity occurred within the timeframe specified by the alert "ATI High Priority Rule Match for Domain Name IoCs". The specific domain(s) triggering the curated rule are among those listed above.

The nature of the domains (associated with malware, C2, SUNBURST, QAKBOT, cryptomining) strongly indicates that the host `windows-prod-1` is compromised or infected.

## Recommendations

1.  **Containment:** Immediately isolate the host `windows-prod-1` from the network to prevent further malicious activity or lateral movement. Trigger the **Basic Endpoint Triage & Isolation Runbook**.
2.  **Investigation:** Perform endpoint forensic analysis on `windows-prod-1` to identify the specific malware or compromise vector.
3.  **Remediation:** Re-image or remediate the compromised host based on forensic findings.
4.  **Blocking:** Ensure all identified malicious domains are blocked at the network perimeter (firewall, proxy, DNS sinkhole). Trigger the **IOC Containment Runbook** for the domains listed in the GTI Enrichment section.
5.  **Review:** Review logs for any successful connections from `10.166.0.3` to IPs resolved from the malicious domains.
