# Investigation Report: Case 2228

**Runbook Used:** create_an_investigation_report.md (Adapted)
**Timestamp:** 2025-05-03 20:38:00 EDT
**Case ID(s):** 2228

## Executive Summary

SOAR Case 2228 (High Priority) was opened due to Alert 14909, triggered by the Chronicle rule "ATI High Priority Rule Match for Domain Name IoCs (network.dns.questions.name)" (Rule ID: `ur_d7ef6fcd-3062-4695-bc12-21ca1cf6569f`). The alert indicates a GCTI Finding related to a DNS query. Investigation revealed that the host `windows-prod-1` (IP `10.166.0.3`) within the `prod-web` GCP project queried the domain `eth-eu1.nanopool.org`. Google Threat Intelligence (GTI) and Security Command Center (SCC) associate this domain with cryptocurrency mining pools. While GTI assigns a low severity, it notes associated high/medium risk communicating files. This activity suggests potential cryptomining software or activity on the host `windows-prod-1`. Further investigation of the host is recommended.

## Investigation Timeline (High-Level)

*   **2025-05-02 09:36:00Z - 10:36:00Z:** Time window of the DNS query event according to the alert.
*   **2025-05-03 08:44:36Z:** Case 2228 created in SOAR.
*   **2025-05-03 20:35:54Z - 20:38:00Z:** Automated investigation initiated:
    *   Retrieved case details.
    *   Retrieved alert events.
    *   Attempted SIEM search for original event ID (failed).
    *   Searched SIEM for related DNS events from source IP.
    *   Enriched domain `eth-eu1.nanopool.org` via GTI.
    *   Performed SIEM entity lookups for IP `10.166.0.3` and hostname `windows-prod-1`.

## Involved Entities & Enrichment Summary

*   **Case:** 2228 (High Priority, Open)
*   **Alert:** 14909 (ATI High Priority Rule Match for Domain Name IoCs)
*   **Rule:** `ur_d7ef6fcd-3062-4695-bc12-21ca1cf6569f`
*   **Host:** `windows-prod-1`
    *   **Resource Path:** `//compute.googleapis.com/projects/prod-web/zones/europe-north1/instances/windows-prod-1`
    *   **IP Address:** `10.166.0.3` (Internal)
    *   **SIEM Lookup (IP):** Asset recently active, no specific alerts/events in summary.
    *   **SIEM Lookup (Hostname):** No information found.
*   **Domain IOC:** `eth-eu1.nanopool.org`
    *   **GTI Report:** Associated with Nanopool Ethereum mining pool. Low GTI severity, but notes associated high/medium risk communicating files. Last seen ITW: 2024-04-30. Mandiant IC Score: 52.
    *   **SCC Finding:** Associated alert indicates SCC finding "Malware: Cryptomining Bad Domain".

## Analysis

The alert correctly identified a DNS query from an internal production host (`windows-prod-1`) to a domain (`eth-eu1.nanopool.org`) known to be associated with cryptocurrency mining pools. This is a strong indicator of potential cryptomining activity on the host, which could be unauthorized software consuming resources or a sign of compromise. The lack of detailed context from SIEM entity lookups for the host/IP might indicate incomplete asset enrichment in Chronicle or limitations of the lookup tool summary. The core finding relies on the GCTI/SCC intelligence associated with the queried domain.

## Actions Taken (During Report Generation)

*   Retrieved case, alert, and event details from SOAR.
*   Searched SIEM for related DNS events.
*   Enriched domain IOC using GTI.
*   Performed SIEM entity lookups for host IP and name.

## Recommendations

1.  **Endpoint Investigation:** Initiate an investigation on the host `windows-prod-1` (IP `10.166.0.3`).
    *   Look for running processes associated with cryptomining (e.g., xmrig, nanopool miners).
    *   Analyze process execution logs, network connections, and scheduled tasks around the time of the DNS query (approx. 2025-05-03 10:35 UTC and potentially earlier based on SIEM lookup first seen date).
    *   Consider executing the "Basic Endpoint Triage & Isolation" runbook if suspicious processes are found.
2.  **Network Blocking:** Consider blocking the domain `eth-eu1.nanopool.org` at the network perimeter (firewall/proxy) if not already blocked by default category filtering. Execute `ioc_containment.md` runbook if desired.
3.  **Review Host Purpose:** Understand the expected function of `windows-prod-1` to determine if any mining activity could possibly be legitimate (highly unlikely in a production web environment).
